# AvenueOne-Old-Design
Avenue One is a consumer insight “laboratory” for product selection and development, first focusing on apparel, that helps brands and retailers make more efficient product decisions using real-world data from browsing and purchasing actions. Avenue One makes product recommendations that enable supply pure-plays and retail pure-plays to approach product marketing with the efficiency of vertically-integrated specialty brands. Unlike existing market research methods such as surveys, focus groups and existing big data analytics that quantify demand indirectly, Avenue One operates an exclusive e-commerce store with new products as a sandbox to observe actual purchase decisions and derive consumer insights.

This one is not currently being used for Avenue One.  
I'm still working on the new version using Magento platform
